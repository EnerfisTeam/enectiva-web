<h1>Administration Buildings</h1>

<p>Enectiva is a complex software solution designed for building owners, administrators and property
and facility managers. It offers comprehensive information about energy management, as well as
about the usability of the leased areas, about the results of <a href="/en/features/#Savings">cost-saving projects</a> and measures and
about the tenants' invoices. In this way, Enectiva makes administration of buildings and building
compounds both easier and cheaper. When combined with automatic and <a href="/en/features/#Readings">remote meter reading</a>
systems, Enectiva enables you to calculate the charges of <a href="/en/features/#Auth">individual tenants</a> automatically.
Information about operating expenditure, as well as revision and waste collection fees, is also
