**Compare the energy efficiency of your buildings**.  40% of all the energy used in the world is consumed in buildings and in their operation. It is almost unbelievable how vastly different are buildings in terms of energy use. Our team has encountered buildings of the same type but with a 100% difference in consumption. There are significant discrepancies between office buildings of the “A” standard which we are monitoring – the most energy efficient building of the “A” standard that we monitor has a yearly consumption of 169 kWh/sqm, while in the case of the least efficient building it is 304 kWh/sqm.![Energetický benchmarking](/img/blog/Benchmarking budov2.png)

## Why is it important to compare buildings? ##

1.	Comparison, or “benchmarking”, is the very first step in the process of improvement of energy efficiency. It has been proven that even the basic version of benchmarking effectively reduces energy consumption, and consequently energy expenses. It may be surprising to you that more than half of saving of energy in buildings is achieved through implementation of low-cost or zero-cost measures in the operation of the buildings.
2.	Benchmarking becomes an important strategic tool especially if the subject of its analysis is a large portfolio of buildings. The vast amount of information thus received helps the administrator of the portfolio to make plans, prioritize and allocate financial resources so that certain goals are achieved in terms of energy performance and sustainability.

## Benchmarking basics
Different buildings can give you different data and values. There are several basic rules you should follow in order to avoid mixing apples with oranges:

1.	Compare buildings in the same climate zone
2.	Compare buildings of similar height
3.	Compare buildings with the same heat source
4.	Compare buildings that are used in the same way


The second point may be surprising, but the height of the building is closely related to the equipment used in the building. This is why a portfolio of building should be divided to at least three elementary categories: Low-rise buildings, middle-rise buildings and high-rise buildings. Another criteria, more suitable for a specific portfolio, may be chosen. Buildings should not be compared only to one another, but also to the average and to the best performance.
